This intelligent file organizer harnesses the power of advanced AI models, including language models (LMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), to automate the process of organizing files by:

Scanning a specified input directory for files.

Content Understanding:

Textual Analysis: Uses the Llama3.2 3B to analyze and summarize text-based content, generating relevant descriptions and filenames.
Visual Content Analysis: Uses the LLaVA-v1.6 , based on Vicuna-7B, to interpret visual files such as images, providing context-aware categorization and descriptions.
Understanding the content of your files (text, images, and more) to generate relevant descriptions, folder names, and filenames.

Organizing the files into a new directory structure based on the generated metadata.

The best part? All AI processing happens 100% on your local device using the Nexa SDK. No internet connection required, no data leaves your computer, and no AI API is needed - keeping your files completely private and secure.

1. Install Python
Before installing the Local File Organizer, make sure you have Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.12 or later.

You can download Python from the official website.

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer.git
Or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

4. Install Nexa SDK Ô∏è
CPU Installation
To install the CPU version of Nexa SDK, run:

pip install nexaai --prefer-binary --index-url https://nexaai.github.io/nexa-sdk/whl/cpu --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple --no-cache-dir

Note: If you encounter issues with any packages, install them individually:

pip install nexa Pillow pytesseract PyMuPDF python-docx
With the environment activated and dependencies installed, run the script using:

6. Running the Scriptüéâ
python main.py
Notes
SDK Models:

The script uses NexaVLMInference and NexaTextInference models usage.
Ensure you have access to these models and they are correctly set up.
You may need to download model files or configure paths.
Dependencies:

pytesseract: Requires Tesseract OCR installed on your system

Processing Time:

Processing may take time depending on the number and size of files.
The script uses multiprocessing to improve performance.
Customizing Prompts:

You can adjust prompts in data_processing.py to change how metadata is generated.
